BDPROTO-LEGACY
==============

This repository contains the BDPROTO legacy data from Egidio Marsico and Sebastien Flavier. The original work comes from:

Marsico, Egidio. 1999. What can a database of proto-languages tell us about the last 10,000 years of sound changes. In Proceedings of the XIVth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences (ICPhS99), 353--356.

An updated and extended BDPROTO database is available at: [https://github.com/bdproto/bdproto](https://github.com/bdproto/bdproto).


CONVERSION NOTES
----------------

## Problems / corrections in the unicode2ipa file:

unicode2ipa (original) contained a many-to-one-mapping:

107	0027	'	02BC	ʼ
108	0027	'	02C0	ˀ

I delete the second occurrence (108) because all rows that contained 0027 in the phonemes (original) table contained the word "ejective".

Also updated:

7	0067	g	0261	ɡ

and to reflect Unicode's inclusion of the LATIN SMALL LETTER V WITH RIGHT HOOK (previously in PUA)

133	0056	2C71	ⱱ


## Missing code points

The IPALA-to-Unicode mapping in "unicode2ipa" (original) was not complete, so additions were made and put into a "unicode2ipa-updated" table. I referred to the PHOIBLE UPSID-to-IPA mappings file.

NOTES
-----

One old version is online, with some php script to do the harmonization, for example:
[http://www.diadm.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/upsid/index.php?set_db=BDPROTO&view=lang&code=1061](http://www.diadm.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/upsid/index.php?set_db=BDPROTO&view=lang&code=1061)
 
change the code value in the example above with the code of the language, and it should work (see data for the code list).
 
For the data I use, I send you a zip with 6 files :
- Languesbdproto_dynaste.sql with basic information about languages and code (to use in the link above)

- Segments_dynaste.sql with links between code (of a language) and APICodeEntier ( of a phoneme)

- Phonemes_dynaste.sql with the APICodeEntier informations (features are in champs1 and Caracteristique). CaractHex represent the phoneme in IPALA (4 digits for each units).

- Caractapi_dynaste.sql with the CodeArticulation(features) for each APICodeEntier in a relational table.

- Articulation_dynaste.sql with the CodeArticulation description.

 
Last file :
- Unicode2ipa_dynaste.sql with the harmonization from ipala to unicode (for each 4 digits found in the field caractHex from the table phonemes)

 
Code in table above and following examples are in hexa.
I found a rule in the php script to harmonize ipala 0067 to 0261 when in a complex segment ( more than 2 units like ɡ͡b … the link is a unit )
 
One more thing :

The unicode 0361 (link between units in a segment) is in a different place in the ipala font (and different code : 2015).
In unicode : between the two units
In ipala : after the two units to join … but there is  one exception : nmg͡b the 2015 is between the 2 units and the first one is 0067 (make the change from 0067 to 0261 )
